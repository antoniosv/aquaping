Overview of aquaping:

Our mobile app, aquaping, attends the need for consulting, providing, and sharing information on contaminated water sources at a specific location both among individual users and interested organizations. We take a crowdsourcing approach, where anyone with a smartphone can submit reports by answering specific questions, taking a picture, and specifying the location. After processing the answers, advice regarding safe water usage is provided.

The mobile app:

Can be found inside the mobile_app folder. In order to be able to develop for both Android and iOS simultaneously, the <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/titanium-platform/">Titanium framework</a> was used.

The web service:

Using the servlet technology, we developed a prototype in which we receive the information from the new report generated from the app, and we direct this information to the emails of the parties subscribed to that area. For now, it's sending all the reports to a static list.

CO2 Pollution Visualization:

Although unrelated at first sight, we worked closely with another team at the SpaceApps challenge that seeked to create useful visualizations of data. We saw a great potential in that, so we collaborated with them with future plans of expanding their idea or concept to create usseful visualizations of data into something that used the data generated from aquaping. This way, we'd make use of their concept of visualization of CO2 pollution into another field, such as water contamination.

In short, they developed a web application that aims to solve the problem that despite having much information about CO2 levels in the atmosphere, the visualization of the information is very unappealing to the people interested in it, and that don't have the required technical knowledge to analyze the data in the format in which they are.
Currently, the application allows viewing of CO2 levels, although the display must be enhanced to allow the user to interact with the application. Future work aims to improve the way you view CO2 levels as well as display the condition of the ozone layer, solar radiation levels and other data relevant to the state of the weather conditions on the planet.
