Overview of aquaping:

Our mobile app, aquaping, attends the need for consulting, providing, and sharing information on contaminated water sources at a specific location both among individual users and interested organizations. We take a crowdsourcing approach, where anyone with a smartphone can submit reports by answering specific questions, taking a picture, and specifying the location. After processing the answers, advice regarding safe water usage is provided.
